# NumPY
#### This assigment is to investigate the Numppy random package <br>
The first part looks at the various functions within the random sampling section <br> 
Found it best to just take a function and running it to see what might be happening <br> 
There is some overlapp between the various function and that can present some confusion <br>
Next looked at random and shuffle <br>
Distribution functions: looked at a number of these <br> did find I had to go back to school hugely <br>
can see how powerful these functions are which is the kernal of the package, it is hugely powerful <br> 
Looked at the seed generator, again its about the testing and trying and playing around with the <br> funciton and <br> introducing elements that can show what this is about. <br>
To run the note book<br>
